# Order Service

Order Service is an application implemented using SAP CAP, SAP HANA integrating with Java/Spring Boot.

## Running project locally

Use the package manager [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to run locally.

```bash
# maven
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## SAP HANA

After providing SAP HANA Cloud instance, added cds-feature-hana dependency and configured the file .cdsrc.json in the root folder.

```bash
{
  "hana" : {
    "deploy-format": "hdbtable"
  }
}
```

Implicitly pushed all artifacts to the database.

```bash
cds deploy --to hana:orders-hana --store-credentials
```

## Deploying it to CF

Run the following command to configure which Cloud Foundry environment you want to connect to in the terminal.

```bash
cf api <CF_API_ENDPOINT>

cf login
```

To deploy project into Cloud Foundry created a application manifest and enabled application for Cloud Foundry.

```bash
mvn clean install

cf push

cf apps
```

## XSUAA for local

While enabling application for Cloud Foundry by adding the cds-starter-cloudfoundry dependency it enabled CAP Javaâ€™s secure-by-default behaviour based on Spring Security. Now we should add some custom mock users to the application via adding the security section to the application.yaml file.

```bash
  security:
    mock:
      users:
        - name: admin
          password: admin
          roles:
            - admin
```

## XSUAA for Cloud Foundry

First we should generate security descriptor.

```bash
cds compile srv/ --to xsuaa > xs-security.json
```

Updated application manifest.

```bash
---
applications:
  - name: order-service
    path: srv/target/order-service-exec.jar
    random-route: true
    services:
      - orders-hana
      - orders-xsuaa
```

Then, created instance of the Authorization and Trust Management Service

```bash
cf create-service xsuaa application orders-xsuaa -c xs-security.json
```

In order to get environment variables for OAuth 2.0, we shoould run following command:

```bash
cf env order-service 
```
