# Order Service

Order Service is an application implemented using SAP CAP, SAP HANA integrating with Java/Spring Boot.

## Running project loccally

Use the package manager [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to to run locally.

```bash
# maven
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## SAP HANA

After providing SAP HANA Cloud instance, configured the file .cdsrc.json in the root folder.

```bash
{
  "hana" : {
    "deploy-format": "hdbtable"
  }
}
```

Implicitly pushed all artifacts to the database.

```bash
cds deploy --to hana:bookstore-hana --store-credentials
```

## Deploying it to CF

To deploy project into Cloud Foundry created a application manifest and enabled application for Cloud Foundry.

```bash
mvn clean install

cf push

cf apps
```

## XSUAA 

While enabling application for Cloud Foundry by adding the cds-starter-cloudfoundry dependency it enabled CAP Javaâ€™s secure-by-default behaviour based on Spring Security. Now we should add some custom mock users to the application via adding the security section to the application.yaml file.

```bash
  security:
    mock:
      users:
        - name: admin
          password: admin
          roles:
            - admin
```
